# Videogames Pynput Utils
Some python scripts to make fun stuff in videogames.

## Nuclear Throne
- <b>frog.py</b>:
This script automatically holds the right click button when you are not holding any directional key (W A S D). This lets Frog walk normally like all the other characters.
- <b>kbAim.py</b>:
This script lets you play the game without the need of using the mouse. Use the numpad to aim, numpad0 to fire and numpad5 to use the active.

To make them work you will need Python and pynput installed.
