# Videogames Pynput Utils
Some python scripts to make fun stuff in videogames.

- <b>ntFrog.py</b>:
This script automatically holds the right click button when you are not holding any directional key (W A S D). This lets Nuclear Throne's character Frog walk normally like all the other mutants.
- <b>kbAim.py</b>:
This script lets you play topdown shooters that use the mouse for aiming (like NT or EtG) without the need of using the mouse. Use the numpad to aim, numpad0 to press the left mouse button and numpad5 to press the right button.
- <b>mouseMove.py</b>:
This script presses the WASD keys to make the player move towords the mouse in topdown games. It can be inverted making going in the oppisite direction by simply changing the boolean value `inverse` in the script.
- <b>osuCircler.py</b>:
This script makes the mouse go in a little square at the center of the screen really fast by pressing the 1 key. So in osu! when a spinner circle appears, press 1 and click (or Z/X). This can give a lot of point on long spinner circles.

<b>WARNING</b>: Don't leave this scripts open after you are done using them.

To make them work you will need Python and pynput installed.
