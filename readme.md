# NTPython
Some python scripts to make fun stuff in Nuclear Throne.

- <b>frog.py</b>:
This script automatically holds the right click button when you are not holding any directional key (W A S D). This lets Frog walk normally like all the other characters.
- <b>kbAim.py</b>:
This script lets you play the game without the need of using the mouse. Use the numpad to aim, numpad0 to fire and numpad5 to use the active.
